## ðŸš€ About

I am a Flutter developer with experience in building cross-platform applications. I developed a fully functioning e-commerce application using Flutter, compatible with both iOS and Android. The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and utilizes RESTful API authentication to securely manage user and product data. State management is handled with Cubit for efficient and responsive updates.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Sign-in, Sign-up, Password Reset, and Log-out functionality.
- **User Profile Management:** Users can update their information, including Name and Phone number.
- **Product Browsing:** View products categorized by type.
- **Product Search:** Search functionality for finding products (currently in development).
- **Performance Optimization:** Image caching for faster load times.
- **Cart Management:** Maintain and manage the shopping cart.
- **Order Placement:** Complete orders with synchronized database updates.
- **User Interface:** Animated buttons, alert messages, images, and navigation bars.
