I developed a fully functioning e-commerce flutter application that is compatible with both iOS & Android. I built it with the MVVM ( Model-View-ViewModel ) architecture, and I used restful api Authentication to securely authenticate users, product details & users' data, and Cubit for state management.
## Features

- Sign-in, Sign-up, Reset password, Log-out.
- Users can edit their information (Name, Phone, number).
- View products by category.
- Search for a product (currently being implemented).
- Cache images for faster load times.
- Maintain cart.
- Make an order.
- All of the above is synced with the database.
- Animated buttons with alert messages.
- Animated images & navigation bar.
